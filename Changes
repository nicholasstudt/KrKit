 Revision history for Perl extension KrKit.
 ------------------------------------------
 
 This should contain the high points of changes between versions.

-- Random Notes --
 - How do you make an application namespace aware the easiest way?
 - Make an "opt" method to the handler to set/get variables.
 - Close down all "dirty" OO hacks used in code.
 - Move database connections/disconnections to init_app/cleanup_app
   maybe use actuall OO inheritance stuff so they can be named correctly
   -- SUPER call based stuff.

 - Should KrKit just die and we port everything to Gantry ?
------------------

0.22
	- Commented out install of httpd.rc file.

0.21 Mon Dec 15 21:27:51 CST 2008
	- use "our" for ISA, EXPORT etc.
	- config table addition.
	- Handler no longer dependant on ht_lines.

0.20
	- Updating to the Apache2::* naming convention for mod_perl 2.000001
	- Adjusted includes to allow for non / and ~/ entries that will
	  check for that file in the cwd and then back down the tree until

	- Added a $site->param to the handler. This solves the
	  Apache2::Request tables immutable status change.
	- Added group management to the Users.pm so you can edit the groups
	  via a multiple select box on the user add/edit screen. This is
	  mostly for an example of working multiple selects in action.

	- Working on the default template some, need to figure out what to
	  make this look and function like.
	- Removed the Porting document from the docs directory, I never did
	  write a good porting from mod_perl 1 to 2 document.
	- removed the remote field from auth_users.

0.10 Thu Dec 23 09:41:36 CST 2004
	- Put cleanroot back into the mix. Sent email to the mod_perl list
	  about path_info. Looks like path_info is known odd with nested
	  locations.
	- Added the frame option to the help category admin.
	- Adjusted the help viewer to use the framing option.
	- Removed the usage of AppBase where it wasn't needed with the
	  functions that moved.

0.09 Wed Dec 22 21:44:41 CST 2004
	- Stubbed out the default template, this still needs work.
	- Fixed the html in Helper::Category and Helper::Category::Items
	- Rechecking path_info, produces some problems with nested
	  locations. My have to revert to cleanroot like functionality.

0.08 Wed Dec 22 10:38:41 CST 2004
	- Altered Control::Groups to use ht_checkbox for checkboxes.
	- Altered Control::Pages to use ht_checkbox for checkboxes.
	- Completed the port of Control::Authen, Control::Authz,
	  Control::Authz::PageBased, Control::Access, and
	  Control::Authen::Cookie.
	- Added the ability to use $site->_init_app to the handler, this
	  allows the augmentation of _init without changeing the default or
	  having to copy it in, should make it easier to deal with
	  applications as well. The module Helper::Category::Items is
	  currently using this functionality.
	- removed appbase_cleanroot $r->path_info does the same thing.
	- moved appbase_relocate into the handler as a method _relocate.
	- Adjusted the handler to redirect and decline faster. It was not
	  skipping the framing on a redirect.
	- Removed checkbox support in ht_input.

0.07 Tue Dec 21 20:56:24 CST 2004
	- Completed port of Control::Pages and Control::Groups.

	- Fixed sql_update to add a space before the where clause.
	- put a warning in ht_input, checkbox, that they should use
	  ht_checkbox instead.
	- added ht_checkbox, works like ht_radio does.
	- Stubbed out the user sync script, ie it has some comments.
	- Imported Control::Authen::Cookie from magic
	- Update the auth schema a bit, add user_id and remote to
	  auth_users, add ident to auth_groups
	- Changed Owner to User in pages.
	- Added "frame varchar" to help_categories, this allows for by
	  category framing, so seperate applications can be framed
	  differently.
	- Completed port of Xpander::Admin.
	- Completed port of Control
	- Completed port of Helper, Helper::Category, and Helper::Category::Items.
	- Completed port of Control::Users

	- The $in->{variable} notation works in
	  libapreq-2.05-snapshot-2004-11-29 with mod_perl-1.99.17.
	- Removed the AUTOLOAD from Handler using ->can instead.
	- Moved KrKit.conf to httpd.conf

0.04 Tue Jun 29 16:12:22 CDT 2004
	- $r->dir_config must be used from Apache::ServerUtil or it gives
	  the wrong answer.
	- Updated Const usage to -compile and Apache::*
	- Working on $in problem some more...
	- $r->sendfile ordering problem confirmed with Stas, way to get the
	  ordering correct is to rflush() before sendfile() more info at:
	  http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/twaxnaldbu
	- All handlers have been modified from "sub handler ($$)" to "sub
	  handler : method"
	- All handlers now take "my ( $self, $r ) = @_;"
	- Updated copyright information in all of the modules.
	- Framing::Template no honors the date and time formats from
	  PerlSetVars, like all other handlers.
	- recieved feedback on the $r->content and Apache::Request issues I
	  have been seeing. Full discussion located at:
	  http://www.mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/selfrerdkrei

0.03 Mon Jun 28 16:25:11 CDT 2004
	- Configuration defaults: Files_* -> File_* 
	- Completed Handler, AppBase, Framing, Framing::Plain,
	  Framing::Template, Xpander,
	- Xpander can now server files correctly. Need to figure out why I
	  must $r->flush before the file send, something seems odd about
	  this.
	- Xpander::Admin is under construction. Trying to work out how to
	  get and set form data reliably.

0.02 Sat Jun 26 22:32:50 CDT 2004
	- Cleaned up the httpd.rc script.
	- Imported everything into CVS.
	- Ported DB, SQL, Validate, and HTML. These modules do not depend on
	  mod_perl, hence this was mostly renaming the Module and their
	  dependancies.
	- sql_update change to not assume the "WHERE" in the clause
	  statement, this was a dangerous behavoir.
	- Added the Porting document do the docs tree this will track all
	  changes that need to be made to existing applications for them to
	  work with the new libraries.

0.01 Fri Jun 26 22:27:35 2004
	- copied in the Magic ( apache 1.0 ) versions of the code as a base.
