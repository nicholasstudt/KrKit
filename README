 Overview
 --------

 KrKit is primarily a web application development library. It contains
 simplified database connectivity, user authorization and
 authentication, a template system, a help system, inherited method
 handlers to simplfy development, and much more. 

 The single biggest stregth of this development library is that unlike
 most other environments is that the developer can use or discard the
 portions that they need. Every library is easy to Superclass or simple
 discard as you, the developer, see fit. While these libraries work in
 the situations we have encountered, yours may be different, and your
 development environment shouldn't work against you.
